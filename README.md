# tic-tac-toe-project

How you approached the problem and broke down

I aproached the problem by writing pseudo code to understand the structure.

An issue you ran into and how you fixed it

The css positioning to get a clean tic tac toe grid was annoying but using the chrome dev tools
allowed me to modify css real time which helped.

A bit of code or functionality you are really proud of

I love the light mode dark mode and how I made it save the setting to the users local storage
so it saved their preferences when they refresh the page.

I have included a reference of how the game stores and checks for winning lines and positioning

Reference to the array game structure

X,O Positioning
//[0],[1],[2]
//[3],[4],[5]
//[6],[7],[8]

Wining line checks
//[6] [7]
// [ ],[ ],[ ] - [0]
// [ ],[ ],[ ] - [1]
// [ ],[ ],[ ] - [2]
// | | |
// [3],[4],[5]
